Multithreaded PostgreSQL Experimental Branch
============================================

This repository is an experimental PostgreSQL branch exploring how PostgreSQL
can run backend sessions in a native multithreaded runtime while preserving the
existing multiprocess backend model.

The aim is not to bolt `pthread_create()` onto PostgreSQL and call it done. The
branch is making backend, session, connection, execution, interrupt, lifecycle,
and wait state explicit so that PostgreSQL can support:

- the existing process-per-backend model;
- a native thread-per-session runtime for regular client backends;
- threaded in-tree worker families where ownership is understood;
- a later scheduler that can run logical sessions or executions on a smaller
  pool of physical carriers.

The current implementation starts from PostgreSQL `REL_19_BETA1`. Phase 12 has
closed the scoped core thread-per-session state-migration gate, and Phase 13
has added the scheduler-visible wait-completion substrate. The active direction
is Phase 14: building pooled carrier scheduling on top of those explicit wait
boundaries while keeping process mode and thread-per-session fallback behavior
healthy.  The current Phase 14 work proves the scheduler-visible wait plumbing
under pooled mode, but it is not yet the final many-sessions-on-fewer-carriers
design.

Important constraints:

- process-mode PostgreSQL must continue to work;
- arbitrary third-party C extensions are not assumed to be thread-safe;
- thread-per-session is a milestone, not the final scheduler design;
- pooled scheduling comes after explicit wait boundaries exist;
- correctness and lifecycle ownership come before broad performance claims.

Current status:

- Phase 12 / Gate E2-Core is closed for the scoped core runtime.
- Phase 13 wait-completion coverage is in place for the core threaded wait
  families: event sets, latches, sockets, frontend input/output, timeout waits,
  condition variables, heavyweight locks, and PGPROC semaphore-backed waits
  including LWLocks.
- Phase 14 is active. The branch now has pooled scheduler queue/requeue
  scaffolding, carrier current-work switching, a carrier scheduler loop,
  frontend-input parking/resume, scheduler wait-set dispatch for parked
  sockets, and pooled-mode exit handoff.
- The pooled scheduler TAP now covers idle frontend input, frontend-output
  backpressure and disconnect cleanup, latch waits, statement-timeout delivery
  while waiting, advisory-lock cancellation, and a small lost-wakeup stress.
  These tests prove wait visibility and wake/cancel behavior in pooled mode
  where the frontend/backend protocol can safely surface the wake.
- Remaining Phase 14 work is substantial: regular client launch still creates
  one physical carrier per client connection, and deep `PgSuspend()` waits such
  as lock waits and frontend output still publish wait-completion records while
  blocking the current carrier. Completing Phase 14 requires the real carrier
  pool and a safe suspension model for waits below the top-level frontend-input
  boundary.
- Process mode remains supported.
- Thread-per-session mode runs regular client backends and normal SQL paths.
- Core backend/session/connection/execution/carrier state has explicit runtime
  ownership sufficient for startup, command execution, PL/pgSQL, core GUC
  behavior, logical interrupts, cancellation, termination, teardown, reconnect,
  worker handoff, and the current in-tree worker runtime scope.
- The branch is still experimental. It is not a production-ready PostgreSQL
  server, does not yet provide a complete pooled carrier scheduler, and does
  not claim contrib-wide threaded extension support.
- Phase 16 owns broader extension hardening, bundled procedural languages
  beyond PL/pgSQL, and the full custom/extension GUC matrix.

Current validation baseline:

- `gmake check`
- `gmake check-threaded`
- `gmake check-threaded-workers`
- `gmake check-threaded-world-core`
- `gmake check-runtime-lifecycles`
- `gmake check-global-lifetimes`
- `git diff --check`

The current dirty Phase 14 tree passed `gmake check`, `gmake check-threaded`,
`gmake check-threaded-workers`, `gmake check-threaded-world-core`, both static
runtime scans, and `git diff --check` in the local WSL development tree on
June 19, 2026. The threaded-world core run included 245 threaded-worker
regression tests, 13 PL/pgSQL tests, 129 isolation tests, the backend-runtime
SQL check, all five backend-runtime TAP files / 273 TAP assertions, lifecycle
checking, and global-lifetime scanning. Re-run the full set before claiming a
new release-quality checkpoint, because this branch intentionally keeps
changing runtime ownership boundaries.

Performance guidance:

Performance work is currently measured against vanilla PostgreSQL 19 beta 1
using vanilla `pgbench` as the client. Local profiles compare three lanes:
vanilla process mode, this branch in process mode, and this branch in
thread-per-session mode.

The most recent five-workload local profile for tiny read-only `pgbench`
workloads showed the branch around parity with vanilla on this machine:

| Workload | Branch process / vanilla | Branch threaded / vanilla |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| `builtin_select_simple` | 0.976 | 1.014 |
| `builtin_select_prepared` | 0.983 | 0.980 |
| `select1_prepared` | 1.003 | 1.029 |
| `bench_one_prepared` | 1.018 | 1.006 |
| `kv_read_prepared` | 0.973 | 0.991 |

Treat these numbers as development guidance, not a portability or production
benchmark. The important current signal is that the scoped thread-per-session
runtime is close enough to vanilla on these small read-only workloads to move
the next optimization effort into scheduler-aware wait and pooled-carrier work.
Future performance work should continue to compare all three lanes, because
some remaining overhead is branch-wide rather than threaded-only.
